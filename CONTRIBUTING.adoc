Contributing to the Globus CLI
==============================

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

If you want to do local development, you can setup a development virtualenv in
`.venv` by running `make localdev`.

Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features
------------------------------------

  - Check if there's a matching
      https://github.com/globus/globus-cli/issues[issue]
      before opening a new issue or pull request
  - When possible, provide a usage example to reproduce bugs

Developer Setup
---------------

These steps should help you setup a development environment for the Globus CLI.

  1. Clone repo:
     `git clone git@github.com:globus/globus-cli.git && cd globus-cli`
  2. Create a virtualenv for development. `make localdev`.
  3. Activate the resulting virtualenv with `source .venv/bin/activate`

You should now have, in your virtualenv, the `globus-cli` installed, pointed at
your local copy of the repo. `globus` will invoke code directly out of the
repo.
You can write and test commands interactively in this setup.

Linting & Testing
-----------------

We use `tox` to run tests and `pre-commit` to run (optional) pre-commit hooks.
Use `pre-commit install` to setup the hooks.

All code is autoformatted with https://github.com/ambv/black[black] and
https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort[isort]. You may run
`make lint` to do this or configure these tools for use in your editor.

Expectations for Pull Requests
------------------------------

  - *Make sure it merges cleanly*. We may request that you rebase if your PR
      has merge conflicts.
  - *List any issues closed by the pull request*
  - *Squash intermediate and fixup commits*. We recommend running
    `git rebase --interactive` prior to submitting a pull request.

These are our guidelines for good commit messages:

  - No lines over 72 characters
  - No GitHub emoji -- use your words
  - Reference issues and pull requests where appropriate
  - Present tense and imperative mood

Additional Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - All options should have descriptive help text
  - For complex functionality, include sample usage in the helptext for the
      relevant command. If it's a specific flag or feature that has complex
      behavior, make it a separate section of the help text. See
      `globus transfer async-transfer --help` for an example
  - Comment liberally in source
  - Every command gets its own module, named after the command name
  - Think very hard before adding a new dependency -- keep the dependencies of
      `globus_cli` as lightweight as possible
  - Use the verbs `create`, `show`, `update`, and `remove` for underlying API
      CRUD operations


Releasing a Version
-------------------

If you are a CLI maintainer, you need to be able to do a release.
For steps, see the link:./RELEASING.adoc[RELEASING doc].
